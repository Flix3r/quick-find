## Configuration
The app is configured using JSON. The config file will be created and opened on first launch. It is reloaded automatically, as long as the config is valid. A JSON schema is available [here](https://github.com/Flix3r/quick-find/blob/main/src-tauri/config.schema.json), as such an editor that supports it, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), is recommended.

## Credits
This app was inspired by [passivestar](https://github.com/passivestar)'s [quickmenu](https://github.com/passivestar/quickmenu).
